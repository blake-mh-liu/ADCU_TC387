# The Can driver(s) in the system specifies which values
# CanHwHandleType and CanIdType of CanGeneralTypes.h have to be used
# at least. Higher values can also be taken by the integrator and has
# to be handled by Can driver(s). Lower values can influence the
# functionality of the Can driver(s).
# These values have to be set in the EB CanIf module:
# * CanIf/CanIfPublicCfg/CanIfPublicHandleTypeEnum and
# * CanIf/CanIfPublicCfg/CanIfPublicCanIdTypeEnum  
# Can GeneralTypes mapping properties for Can stack 
# If CanHwHandleType and CanIdType is specified here in this
# properties file EB CanIf module will
# verify the used values in CanIf against below specified values.

# CanHwHandleType is in range of UINT8 (Standard) or UINT16 (Extended)
CanGeneralTypes.CanHwHandleType.Mapping: UINT8

# CanIdType UINT16 (Standard) or UINT32 (Extended)
CanGeneralTypes.CanIdType.Mapping: UINT32
