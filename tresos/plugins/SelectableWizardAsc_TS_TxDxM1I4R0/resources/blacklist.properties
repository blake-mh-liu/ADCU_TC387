# this file contains a list of xpath expressions pointing to elements which shall not be copied from the master- to the slave-projects
# from the "PostBuild Selectable Variant Handling unattended wizard"

# NOTE: unfortunately it is not possible to use other than XPaths (e.g. ASPathDataOfSchema or XPathDataOfSchema will not work)
#       therefore, the xpath function node:stod shall be used
# NOTE: special signs like colon (':') or equals ('=') must be quoted by a preceeding backslash
