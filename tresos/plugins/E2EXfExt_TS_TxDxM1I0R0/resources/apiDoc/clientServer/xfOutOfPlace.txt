/**
 ** \brief <TRANSFORMER_NAME> - Protects the array/buffer to be transmitted, using the out-of-place transformation.
 **
 ** \param[in]  extractProtocolHeaderFields  This is the pointer to the function that extracts
 **             relevant protocol header fields. It is used for E2E method profiles (PXXm).
 ** \param[in]  csTransactionHandle  This is the pointer to the E2E transaction handle for the C/S method call.
 **             It is used to tunnel the relevant information (E2E Source ID and E2E Counter) from the request
 **             to the response at the server side via the RTE. It is used for E2E method profiles (PXXm).
 ** \param[in]  InputBufferPtr  This argument holds the input data for the transformer.
 ** \param[in]  InputBufferLength  This argument holds the length of the E2E transformer's input
 **             data (in the inputBuffer argument).
 ** \param[out]  BufferPtr  This is the buffer where the E2E transformer places its output data.
 **             It is the buffer allocated by the RTE, where the transformed data has to be stored
 **             by the transformer.
 ** \param[out]  BufferLengthPtr  Used length of the buffer
 **
 ** \return Function execution success status
 ** \retval 0x00  (E_OK): Function performed successfully.
 ** \retval 0xFF  (E_SAFETY_HARD_RUNTIMEERROR): A runtime error occurred, safety properties could
 **               not be checked and no output data could be produced.
 **
 ** \ServiceID{0x03}
 ** \Reentrancy{Non Reentrant}
 ** \Synchronicity{Synchronous}
