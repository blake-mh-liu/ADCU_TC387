/**
 ** \brief <TRANSFORMER_NAME> - Protects the array/buffer to be transmitted, using the in-place transformation.
 **
 ** \param[in]  InputBufferLength  This argument holds the length of the E2E transformer's input
 **             data (in the inputBuffer argument).
 ** \param[in,out]  BufferPtr  This is the buffer where the E2E transformer places its output data.
 **             With the E2E transformer configured for in-place transformation, it also contains
 **             its input data.
 **             With the E2E transformer using in-place transformation and having a headerLength
 **             different from 0, the output data of the previous transformer begin at position
 **             headerLength.
 **             It is the buffer allocated by the RTE, where the transformed data has to be stored
 **             by the transformer.
 ** \param[out]  BufferLengthPtr  Used length of the buffer
 **
 ** \return Function execution success status
 ** \retval 0x00  (E_OK): Function performed successfully.
 ** \retval 0xFF  (E_SAFETY_HARD_RUNTIMEERROR): A runtime error occurred, safety properties could
 **               not be checked and no output data could be produced.

 ** \ServiceID{0x03}
